Adds buttons and features to the Distraction Free Writing Mode for all kinds of extra functions.

== Description ==

Note: Just Writing now has beta support WordPress 4.1, please see further down this page for more details.

Distraction Free Writing (DFW) Mode is a great way to focus on writing text, but have you ever found yourself wanting to do a bit more with it?  How about spell check, or change the paragraph style without dropping back to the standard post edit mode?  Now you can get all the functionality of the standard mode tools in DFW!

But maybe you think there are too many buttons in DFW, no problem you can get rid of pretty much all of them!

Just Writing takes DFW from a great way to write to a great way of writing posts!

= WordPress 4.1+ Support =

DFW in WP4.1 is a completely different than previous versions and Just Writing takes a completely different approach to it.  Instead of adding buttons and features to WordPress's built in DFW, Just Writing adds a new "Writing" mode to WordPress.

"Writing" mode closely matches the old DFW from previous version of WordPress but has all the features of Just Writing.

There are a few differences however:

	* Switching between the edit page and writing mode, unlike the old DFW, requires a full page load.
	* There are a few hard coded pieces around, so there may be some weird effects with non-english languages.
    * Support for full meta data editing inside of Writing mode.
	* Closing and re-arranging postboxes in the meta area are not saved between sessions.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the just-writing folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.
3. Login to WordPress and go to your profile page, update the options at the bottom.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What browsers are supported? =

Try it and find out, the JavaScript is pretty basic so it should work in just about any browser.  I've successfully run it on:

	* IE 11
	* Opera 12.16
	* FireFox 24/25
	* Chrome 31

= I can't find the Just Writing options, where are they? =

For standard users (aka non-admin users), they can go to their WordPress settings page and select "Profile", scroll down to the bottom and your see the Just Writing section.

For admin users it can be found under "Users"->"Your Profile".

= I've disabled the fade effect and now the browser is running slowly, what's wrong? =

The fade effect is triggered by WordPress when no mouse movement is executed for 2 seconds, the only (without changing some of the WordPress sources files at least) way to disable it is to execute a mousemove event every 1.5 seconds.  This shouldn't be an issue in any modern browser, but if your having performance issues, simply re-enable the fade effect.

= I've disabled the fade effect but there is a 'flicker' when DFW comes up, what's wrong? =

If you start DFW without moving the mouse you might hit right between when WordPress starts fading but before Just Writing fires off a mousemove event, this shouldn't be an issue after the first start of DFW.

= I've added the spellcheck button to my toolbar but it doesn't do anything when I click it =

As of WordPress 3.6, the spellchecker is no longer part of the core WordPress install, you need to add a plugin to get the functionality back.  I'd suggest [TinyMCE SpellChecker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-spellcheck/) as a good option.

= The "Paste as Word" button doesn't show up in WordPress 3.9, why not? =

WordPress 3.9 removed the "Paste as Word" button as the functionality is built in to TinyMCE now.  Just paste your word content in to the visual editor and the formatting will be maintained.

= Browser full screen mode isn't working... =

Browser full screen mode is highly dependent on the browser, it may not work for you.  For example Safari blocks keyboard input during full screen mode.

If it's not working for you try another browser.

= Why can't the browser full screen mode be auto loaded like DFW =

Two words for you: Browser Security.

Modern browsers support full screen mode but they only activate it when a user clicks on a button, there's no way to fake it through JavaScript.  Thats so that a malicous web site doesn't try and impersonate your OS and get you to enter a password that it steal.

The other issue is that full screen mode is de-activated as soon as you leave the current page, so for example Just Writing could link full screen mode to the DFW "click" in the post list, but as soon as the browser leaves the post list to load the editor page full screen mode will be deactivated.

= I'm using the "Avia Layout Builder" and when I use Just Writing my chnages don't get published, what's wrong? =

Unfortunately the "Avia Layout Builder" is incompatible with Just Writing.
